<span style="font-size:13px"> Options for conforming spectra to a new wavenumber resolution. Conformation technique specifies the strategy for performing the conformation. Nearest will use the nearest value to the wavenumber resolution specified, this is faster but less accurate. Linear Interpolation will perform a linear regression between the nearest points to identify the intensity values at the new wavenumbers. Wavenumber Resolution will set the step size in wavenumbers for the new wavenumber values.</span>
