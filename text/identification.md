<span style="font-size:13px"> These options define the strategy for identification. The ID Library will inform which library is used. Both (default) will search both FTIR and Raman libraries. Deriv will search against a derivative transformed library. No Baseline will search against a baseline corrected library. This should be in line with how you choose to process your spectra. Cor options use a simple Pearson correlation search algorithm. AI is uses either a multinomial model (experimental) or correlation on mediod (default) spectra from the library. Correlation thresholding will set the minimum value from matching to use as a 'positive identification'</span>
