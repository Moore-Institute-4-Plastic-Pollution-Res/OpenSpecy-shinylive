<span style="font-size:13px"> Open Specy assumes spectra are in Absorbance units. If the uploaded spectrum is not in absorbance units,
use this input to specify the units to convert from.The transmittance adjustment uses the log10(1/T) calculation which does not correct for system and particle characteristics. The reflectance adjustment uses the Kubelka-Munk equation (1-R)2/(2*R). We assume that the reflectance is formatted as a percent from 1-100 and first correct the intensity by dividing by 100 so that it fits the form expected by the equation. If none is selected, Open Specy assumes that the uploaded data is an absorbance spectrum.</span>
